Time Display
Create a controller called Times and have one method called main. When the user goes to localhost:3000 main should render a view and pass that view a variable containing the current date and time and display that date and time on the view page.

When you're working with a web app, it's important that you understand how the data can be passed from the controller to the view. This assignment is to help you understand how this is done in Rails.
